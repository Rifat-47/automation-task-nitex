# Project Title

Automation task for Nitex.

Automated Test Implementation:
Write a Selenium script to automate the following user journey:
Navigate to the "Event Scheduler" page.
Fill in the event creation form with necessary details (e.g., title, date, participants).
Submit the form to create a new event.
Verify that the event appears in the user's event list with the correct details.
The test should be executable on Chrome browser.


## Run Locally
As we are assuming, it's a web application, to run locally, we need to add the correct url and xpath for the elements. 
The process to run locally is given below:

Clone the project

```bash
  https://github.com/Rifat-47/automation-task-nitex.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd automation-task-nitex
```

Install virtual environment

```bash
   pip install virtualenv
```

Create a virtual environment with name 'venvname'

```bash
  venvname\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the python script
```bash
  python nitex.py
```
Execution results will be printed.

Now, Deactivate virtual environment (on windows command prompt/powetshell)
```bash
   deactivate
```
